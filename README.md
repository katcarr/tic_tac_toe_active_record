Tic-Tac-Toe
======================

A Ruby Sinatra interactive web application for playing the fun and exciting game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Installation
------------

To run the primary application and/or any of the included RSpec files for
testing, run either the included Gemfile or manually
install the following gems:

```ruby
rspec
shoulda-matchers
rake
sinatra
sinatra-contrib
sinatra-activerecord
pg
```

If you want to run the included Gemfile, enter the following statements into
the command line:

bundle
```

Before the application can run, the user must have a version of
a Postgres database installed on their system, and running in an active session. At the time of

```rake
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:test:prepare
```

At the time of initial creation of this application, Ruby
version 2.2.0 was used.
